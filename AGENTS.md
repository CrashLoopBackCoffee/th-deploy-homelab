# Agent Instructions for deploy-homelab

This document provides guidance for AI assistants working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a homelab infrastructure-as-code project that uses **Pulumi** with **Python** to manage and deploy various services across multiple environments. The project is built on top of **Proxmox** for virtualization and uses **MicroK8s** for the Kubernetes cluster. **Cloudflare** is used for DNS and other services.

The project follows a microservices architecture with each service in its own workspace. It emphasizes code quality, using tools like `ruff` for linting and `pyright` for type checking.

## Project Structure

### Core Architecture

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Infrastructure**: Pulumi (Infrastructure as Code)
- **Package Management**: UV (Python package manager)
- **Environment Management**: Multiple Pulumi stacks (dev, test, prod)

### Service Organization

```
services/
â”œâ”€â”€ backup/           # Restic and Rclone backup management
â”œâ”€â”€ ingress/          # Cloudflared tunnels and ingress management
â”œâ”€â”€ iot/              # IoT services (MQTT, Z-Wave, monitoring)
â”œâ”€â”€ kubernetes/       # MicroK8s cluster management
â”œâ”€â”€ monitoring/       # Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ obsidian/         # Obsidian knowledge management
â”œâ”€â”€ ollama/           # Ollama large language model service
â”œâ”€â”€ paperless/        # Document management system
â”œâ”€â”€ proxmox/          # Proxmox VE infrastructure with Ansible
â”œâ”€â”€ s3/               # MinIO S3-compatible storage
â””â”€â”€ unifi/            # UniFi network management
```

### Additional Repository Structure

- **`docs/`**: Contains example code and documentation for common patterns (e.g., `cnpg_postgres.py`)
- **`utils/`**: Shared utility modules for common functionality across services
- **`scripts/`**: Helper scripts for development and maintenance
- **`renovate.json5`**: Automated dependency update configuration

## Critical Development Rules

### 1. Shell Commands
- **NEVER** use `cd foo && command` as this changes the current working directory of the shell.
- **ALWAYS** use subshells instead: `(cd foo && command)` to isolate directory changes.
- **VIOLATION OF THIS RULE IS CRITICAL** - changing the working directory breaks the shell session for other commands.

### 2. Code Quality & Linting
- **ALWAYS** run `uv run ./scripts/run-all-checks.sh` before making any commit to ensure code quality.
- **CRITICAL**: Run linting checks BEFORE manually fixing any code issues - many linters auto-fix problems automatically.
- The project uses multiple linting tools configured via pre-commit:
  - **Ruff**: Python code formatting (`ruff format`) and linting (`ruff check --fix`).
  - **Pyright**: Python type checking.
  - **Yamllint**: YAML file linting.
  - **Pre-commit hooks**: Various file checks (TOML, whitespace, etc.).
  - **Alloy format**: Grafana Alloy configuration formatting.
- **NEVER** commit code that fails linting checks.

### 3. Pulumi Commands & Safety
- **ALWAYS** run `pulumi preview` with `--diff` before any `pulumi up` command to check for unexpected changes.
- **ALWAYS** use the `--non-interactive` flag with Pulumi commands (`up`, `preview`, etc.) to prevent interactive mode from breaking terminal integration.
- When renaming a resource, preserve state with aliases via `pulumi.ResourceOptions(aliases=[pulumi.Alias(name='old-name')])` to avoid recreation.

### 4. Python Code Style
- Use type hints consistently and follow PEP 8.
- Prefer composition over inheritance for Pulumi components.
- Use dataclasses or Pydantic models for structured data.
- Keep dependency lists in `pyproject.toml` sorted alphabetically.
- **Import Style**: Follow project import conventions:
  - Use `import ...` for external libraries (e.g., `import json`).
  - Use `from ... import ...` for internal/project imports.
  - Use standard abbreviations (and ONLY these):
    - `import typing as t`
    - `import pulumi as p`
    - `import pulumi_kubernetes as k8s`
    - `import collections.abc as c`
  - Use full module names for other imports: `import pathlib`.
- **Pydantic**: Don't use pydantic aliases, they are auto-generated by `utils.model.LocalBaseModel`.

### 5. Container Image Management
- **NEVER** hardcode image tags in Python code.
- **ALWAYS** include image versions in the configuration model (`config.py`).
- **ALWAYS** verify version numbers against actual releases.
- **PREFER official container images** over runtime tool downloads.
- **ALWAYS** add renovate comments above version fields in `Pulumi.{stack}.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  # renovate: datasource=github-releases packageName=<owner>/<repo> versioning=semver
  <service>-version: <version>
  ```
- Use the config value in Python code: `f'{image_name}:{component_config.service.version}'`.

### 6. Helm Chart Management
- **PREFER `k8s.helm.v4.Chart`** over `k8s.helm.v3.Release` when possible for better resource visibility.
- `Chart` creates individual Pulumi resources for each Helm resource, enabling better dependency tracking and resource management.
- `Release` creates an opaque Helm resource where Pulumi has no control over the child resources.
- **EXCEPTION**: Use `k8s.helm.v3.Release` when the Helm chart uses hooks (pre-install, post-install, pre-delete, post-delete, etc.).
- **ALWAYS** analyze Helm charts for hook usage before choosing between Chart and Release:
  - Check chart templates for `"helm.sh/hook"` annotations.
  - Common hook usage: database initialization, migration jobs, cleanup tasks.
- Use `k8s.helm.v4.Chart` for most modern operators and simple applications.
- Use `k8s.helm.v3.Release` for complex applications with lifecycle hooks.

### 7. Git Workflow
- Every change must happen on a feature branch and be performed via pull request.
- Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-prometheus-monitoring`).
- Use `hub sync` to keep branches clean.
- Never commit directly to the main branch.

### 8. Kubernetes
- Never set CPU limits on pods.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Install/sync dependencies
uv sync

# Add a new dependency
uv add <package_name>

# Generate configuration schemas
uv run ./scripts/generate-config-schema

# CRITICAL: Run all linting and code quality checks (many tools auto-fix)
uv run ./scripts/run-all-checks.sh

# Deploy a service (ALWAYS preview first)
(cd services/{service-name} && pulumi preview -s {stack-name} --diff --non-interactive)
(cd services/{service-name} && pulumi up --stack {stack-name} --non-interactive --skip-preview)

# List available stacks for a service
(cd services/{service-name} && pulumi stack ls)

# Check stack configuration
(cd services/{service-name} && pulumi config --stack {stack-name})
```

## Environment Management (Pulumi Stacks)

- **Production (`prod`)**: Primary homelab environment for most services.
- **Development (`dev`)**: Legacy services from a previous migration (`monitoring`, `proxmox`, `s3`).
- **Test (`test`)**: Experimental environment, especially for `kubernetes` changes.

## AI Assistant Guidelines

1.  **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL - Pulumi Safety**: **ALWAYS** run `pulumi preview --diff` before `pulumi up`.
2.  **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL - Code Quality**: **ALWAYS** run `uv run ./scripts/run-all-checks.sh` before committing.
3.  **Understand Service Context**: Each service in `services/` is self-contained but may have dependencies.
4.  **Follow Patterns**: Use established patterns for Pulumi, configuration, and code style.
5.  **Configuration**: Remember to configure python runtime options in `Pulumi.yaml` using `uv` and the `venv` in the root of the repository.
6.  **MCP Interactive Feedback (Copilot)**:
    - When you want to ask a question, call the MCP `interactive_feedback`.
    - Before completing a request, call MCP `interactive_feedback`.
    - Keep calling MCP until the user's feedback is empty, then end the request.

## Documentation Maintenance

These instructions should be periodically validated against the repository state:
- Verify all services in the `services/` directory are documented
- Ensure all scripts and tools mentioned actually exist and work
- Check that code examples follow current project patterns
- Update tooling versions and commands as the project evolves
